# DDCL Unleashed — Project Context

## MANDATORY UPDATE PROTOCOL

Every session must follow these rules — no exceptions.

**At session start:** Read this file. Then read the relevant section of `PLAN.md` for the current phase.

**During the session — update the right file immediately when something happens:**

| Event | File to update |
|-------|---------------|
| Bug found or fixed | `docs/ISSUES_TRACKER.md` — add entry before fixing |
| Code file created or changed | `PLAN.md` — mark task done; update phase status if phase completes |
| New sweep results generated | Re-run `report_baseline.py`; replace `docs/results/<sweep>/` |
| Experiment procedure changes | `docs/README.md §5` |
| Mathematical finding or correction | `docs/MATH.md` |
| Statistical method added or changed | `docs/STATS.md` |
| Session ends | Add entry to Session Log below; update "Current State" block |

**Never duplicate information across files.** Each fact lives in exactly one place:
- What the code does → `docs/README.md`
- What is planned and what is done → `PLAN.md`
- What broke and how it was fixed → `docs/ISSUES_TRACKER.md`
- Mathematical derivations → `docs/MATH.md`
- Statistical methods → `docs/STATS.md`
- Current running state → this file (CONTEXT.md) only

## Project in One Paragraph

Rigorous testbed for DDCL (Differentiable Discrete Communication Learning) on a toy 2-agent MARL problem (`CommunicatingGoal`). Goals: (1) verify mathematical correctness, (2) find strong baseline via systematic sweeps, (3) implement and ablate 4 principled extensions ("pillars"), (4) show scaling behaviour. All results are statistically honest: raw CSVs, bootstrap CIs, permutation tests, IQM. Full plan: `PLAN.md`. Bug log: `docs/ISSUES_TRACKER.md`. How to run: `docs/README.md §5`.

**Environment:** `marl_comms` conda env (Python 3.10). Prefix every command: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE conda run -n marl_comms <cmd>` (macOS OpenMP conflict workaround — INSTALL-005).

## Current State

**Phase:** 2 — Hyperparameter sweeps  
**Running:** Stage A sweep — ~98/2175 runs done as of 2026-04-24 (nohup-detached)  
**Immediate next action:** Wait for Stage A to finish, then run `report_baseline.py` + `generate_all_paper_figures`. See `PLAN.md §Phase 2 — What remains after Stage A`.

**Check sweep:** `ps aux | grep run_sweep | grep -v grep`  
**Completed runs:** `find onpolicy/envs/toyproblem/runs/sweep_stage_a -name metrics.csv | wc -l`  
**Restart if needed:**
```bash
cd on-policy && nohup bash -c 'KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE conda run -n marl_comms \
    python -m onpolicy.scripts.sweeps.toyproblem.run_sweep \
    --config onpolicy/scripts/sweeps/toyproblem/configs/sweep_stage_a.yaml \
    --seeds 0 1 2 3 4 --log_dir onpolicy/envs/toyproblem/runs/sweep_stage_a \
    --resume --shuffle' > /tmp/sweep_stage_a.log 2>&1 &
```

## Session Log

*Keep entries concise. One paragraph per session maximum.*

**Session 7 (2026-04-24):** Consolidated documentation from 7 → 5 files. CONTEXT.md stripped to current-state-only; PLAN.md is now single source of truth for phase status and what-is-done; KNOWN_ISSUES.md deleted and content moved to ISSUES_TRACKER.md §Pre-existing Issues; config.json exp_name fixed in all 95 recovered runs; stale `docs/results/sweep_stage_a/` deleted. Committed `2be01be`, `921946a`.

**Session 6 (2026-04-24):** CODE-009 — `_run_key()` 80-char truncation caused 2080 runs silently skipped; fixed to use only varying params; 95 runs recovered from checkpoint args and renamed. Sweep restarted. All Phase 2 infrastructure committed. Channel comparison and partial Stage A plots generated. CONTEXT/ISSUES_TRACKER/README updated.

**Session 5 (2026-04-24):** Pre-sweep audit: CODE-007 (additive_uniform missing from Stage A), CODE-008 (none channel redundancy). Jensen gap + RL uncertainty model added to per-goal plot. `analysis/paper_figures.py` created (12 figures). Results path moved to toyproblem-local `runs/`. PLAN/CONTEXT/ISSUES_TRACKER updated.

**Session 3 (2026-04-22):** Phase 2 infrastructure complete. Analysis module, stats, plots, sweep convergence, report_baseline, paper_figures. Baseline channels (additive_uniform, gaussian, ste4/8/16). Experiments (validate_env, validate_mappo, run_channel_comparison). Sweep configs and run_sweep.py. 79 tests passing.

**Session 2 (2026-04-22):** Phase 1 complete. 51 tests passing. Bit-cost formula fixed. MATH-002: NSD variance = δ²/4 not δ²/6. Per-goal bit logging (buffer goal_ids, trainer metrics, train.py CSV columns). `configs/baseline_v0.yaml` created.

**Session 1 (2026-04-22):** Phase 0 complete. 5-phase plan designed and approved. docs/ (README, MATH, KNOWN_ISSUES), tests/ skeleton, train.py hardened (set_seed, --exp_name, log dir). INSTALL-001–005 resolved.
